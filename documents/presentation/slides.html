# 🧮 PageRank

---

.font80[PageRank is a **link analysis algorithm that computes the numerical weight of a node in a graph**, given the number of incoming edges.

It is notably used to compute web pages' weight (as done at Google) given the hyperlinks and references linked to it.]

# The Recursive Approach

Given a graph $G$

Neural Textures is an **extension of Face2Face** to track and generate facial features. 
<br/><br/><br/>
The learning approach revolves around using **Generative Adversarial Network** to compute the mouth area. **Goal**: to reduce the computational complexity of relying on a database
