This repository covers the implementation of two simple Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that are able to learn and determine the PageRank value of a graph.

As such, the repository contains:
- A program to compute the PageRank value of a given graph
- A random graph generator based on Erdos' random graph and scale-free generation
- A GNN with relaxation
- A GNN with a convolutional graph approach

The python implementations are available in the `script` folder and all details and discussion are covered in the file `page_rank_gnn.ipynb` in the `root`.
